# Partwright -- AI Agent Instructions

Partwright is a browser-based parametric CAD tool with four modeling engines: **manifold-js** (default, JavaScript DSL with manifold-3d API + a `Curves` helper namespace), **OpenSCAD** (SCAD language via WASM, with BOSL2 bundled), **BREP / replicad** (JavaScript with `api.BREP.*` — OpenCASCADE B-rep for exact fillets/chamfers and STEP export), and **voxel** (JavaScript — blocky colored-cube modeling for pixel-art and image-derived models; see `/ai/voxel.md`). You write code that constructs 3D geometry, which renders live. All interaction is via the `window.partwright` programmatic API -- do not drive the app through clicks or keystrokes. `window.mainifold` remains available as a legacy alias for older prompts.

**Coordinate system:** Right-handed, Z-up. XY plane is the ground. **Front = +Y, back = −Y** — the default Front view camera sits on the +Y side looking in the −Y direction, so build models with their intended front face pointing in the +Y direction (normal toward +Y). Right = +X, left = −X. Units are arbitrary.

## Before you start

1. **Use `window.partwright`** -- that's the programmatic API. Do NOT drive the app with clicks, keystrokes, or DOM manipulation.
2. **Pick your engine:** manifold-js (default) or OpenSCAD. See [Choosing an engine](#choosing-an-engine).
3. **manifold-js code must end with `return manifoldObject;`** -- a bare trailing expression won't work. OpenSCAD code uses standard SCAD syntax (no `return`).
4. **Use `runAndSave(code, label, {isManifold: true, maxComponents: 1})`** to validate and commit a version.
5. **Verify visually after structural changes.** Stats alone can't catch warped roofs, twisted spires, or wrong proportions. Call `renderViews()` to see several angles at once, and `renderViews({views: "box"})` for a guaranteed all-faces check before declaring done. See [Visual verification](#visual-verification).
6. **Log decisions with `addSessionNote("[PREFIX] ...")`** -- prefixes: `[REQUIREMENT]`, `[DECISION]`, `[FEEDBACK]`, `[MEASUREMENT]`, `[ATTEMPT]`, `[TODO]`.
7. **`await` every async method.** `createSession`, `runAndSave`, `runAndAssert`, `runIsolated`, `runAndExplain`, `loadVersion`, `forkVersion`, `getSessionContext`, every `*Data()` export, every notes/sessions call returns a Promise. Without `await` you'll inspect the Promise object instead of the result and silently work from stale or empty data.

## Choosing an engine

Partwright supports four modeling engines. The table below covers the three solid/CSG engines; the fourth, **voxel**, is a blocky colored-cube engine for pixel-art and image-derived models (`return api.voxels()…`) — see `/ai/voxel.md`. Pick whichever is best for the task:

| | **manifold-js** (default) | **OpenSCAD** (SCAD) | **BREP / replicad** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Language | JavaScript | OpenSCAD `.scad` | JavaScript (`api.BREP.*`) |
| Kernel | manifold-3d mesh | OpenSCAD CSG | OpenCASCADE B-rep |
| Best for | Algorithmic geometry, smooth curves, mesh-level ops (`warp`/`levelSet`/`smoothOut`), painting | Mechanical parts with BOSL2 (threads, gears, attachables), porting existing `.scad` files | True edge fillets/chamfers, exact surfaces, STEP export, mechanical-CAD interop |
| Code style | `return Manifold.cube([10,10,10], true);` | `cube([10,10,10], center=true);` | `return BREP.box([10,10,10]).fillet(2);` |
| Unique strengths | `Curves.loft/sweep/naca4`; `levelSet`/`warp`/`smoothOut` (mesh-level) | BOSL2's `cuboid(rounding=)`, `skin()`, `path_sweep()`, `threaded_rod()`, `spur_gear()` | Exact `fillet()`/`chamfer()`, `.blobSTEP()` export, BREP shapes survive across runs |
| Limitations | Must learn the manifold-3d API | No `text()` (fonts not loaded), slower per-run (~100-300ms WASM init) | No `warp`/`levelSet`; no `Curves` helpers; 10 MB WASM lazy-load on first use |

**Crucial:** You can ALSO use the BREP namespace **inside a manifold-js session** without switching languages — `api.BREP.box(...).fillet(r)`, then `api.BREP.toManifold(shape, api.Manifold)` to drop back into the Manifold world. This is the right move for "one feature needs an exact fillet" without committing to a BREP-only session. Switch to the **replicad** language only when you need STEP export of the *combined* shape, or when the part is dominated by BREP operations. See `/ai/replicad.md` for the full BREP API.

### Switching engines

```js
partwright.getActiveLanguage()        // -> 'manifold-js' or 'scad' or 'replicad' or 'voxel'
await partwright.setActiveLanguage('scad')
await partwright.setActiveLanguage('manifold-js')
await partwright.setActiveLanguage('replicad')
await partwright.setActiveLanguage('voxel')
```

Switching is non-destructive. Your in-progress code in the previous language is stashed as a per-session draft and restored when you switch back — both languages stay live until the session is deleted. Saved versions are not touched; each version remembers the language it was authored in, and navigating to one auto-swaps the engine. A single session can hold mixed manifold-js + SCAD versions.

Selecting a SCAD example from the toolbar dropdown auto-switches to OpenSCAD mode.

## What do I do for X? (verb decision tree)

Reach for the right tool the first time. If the table sends you to a subdoc, fetch it before writing code.

| Want | manifold-js | OpenSCAD | BREP (`api.BREP.*`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cube / sphere / cylinder | `Manifold.cube/sphere/cylinder(...)` | `cube()`, `sphere()`, `cylinder()` | `BREP.box([w,d,h])`, `BREP.sphere(r)`, `BREP.cylinder(r, h)` |
| Boolean union / difference / intersection | `.add(o)`, `.subtract(o)`, `.intersect(o)` | `union(){...}`, `difference(){...}`, `intersection(){...}` | `.fuse(o)` / `.cut(o)` / `.intersect(o)`, or `BREP.fuseAll([a,b,c])` / `BREP.cutAll([body,…holes])` / `BREP.intersectAll([…])` for N-way |

| Round/chamfer ONLY specific edges (e.g. top rim only) | (not available) | BOSL2 `edge_profile()` (rough) | **`.fillet(r, {minZ, maxZ, nearPoint+withinDist, parallelToPlane, inDirection})` — selective, BREP-only. See `/ai/replicad.md` for the full EdgeFilter.** |
| STEP export | (not available) | (not available) | **`partwright.exportSTEP()` after a BREP-language run -> `/ai/replicad.md`** |
| STEP import (read a `.step` / `.stp` file as a CAD shape) | (use partwright.importFile UI, choose manifold-js — tessellates) | (not available) | **partwright.importFile UI, choose BREP — preserves exact surfaces. `api.imports[0]` in the replicad sandbox is the BrepShape.** |
| Ring/linear/mirror copies | `api.circularPattern / linearPattern / mirrorCopy` (or `Curves.ringCopy / linearCopy / mirrorCopy`) | BOSL2 `ring_copies()`, `xcopies()`, `mirror_copy()` | (use manifold-js helpers) |
| Place A on top of B (no mental trig) | `api.placeOn(a, b, {gap?, at?})` | BOSL2 attachments: `attach(TOP, BOTTOM)` | (use manifold-js — convert BREP→Manifold first) |
| Align A's edge/face to B (per axis) | `api.alignTo(a, b, {x?, y?, z?})` (min/max/center) | BOSL2 `position()`/`anchor()` | (use manifold-js — convert BREP→Manifold first) |
| Do two shapes overlap? Volume change? | `api.intersects(a, b)`, `api.volumeDelta(a, b)` | (no equivalent; render and check stats) | (use manifold-js — convert BREP→Manifold first) |
| Is a point inside the solid? | `api.pointInside(m, [x,y,z])` | (no equivalent) | (use manifold-js — convert BREP→Manifold first) |
| Did my boolean give the expected component count? | `api.expectUnion(parts, {expectComponents})` | (no equivalent — check stats `componentCount` after run) | (use manifold-js — convert BREP→Manifold first) |
| Per-piece bbox + volume (find leaked components) | `api.componentBounds(m)` or window `partwright.componentBounds()` | `partwright.componentBounds()` (window API, works for SCAD too) | `partwright.componentBounds()` (window API — works on tessellated mesh) |
| Repair a non-manifold mesh after a failing boolean / STL import | `api.heal(m)` (or window `partwright.healCurrent()`) | `partwright.healCurrent()` (window API) | `partwright.healCurrent()` (works on tessellated mesh) |
| Cross-section image (any axis, for debugging cavities) | `partwright.renderSection({axis, offset?, size?})` | `partwright.renderSection(...)` — same window API | `partwright.renderSection(...)` — same window API |

| Spur / bevel / worm gear | (sample involute manually) | BOSL2 `spur_gear()`, `bevel_gear()`, `worm_gear()` | (coming; today use OpenSCAD/BOSL2) |
| Smooth fillet / blend between two shapes (no edge-picking) | `a.smoothUnion(b, k)` via `api.sdf` -> `/ai/sdf.md` | (not available) | (mesh-only; not in BREP) |

| Implicit surface / raw SDF function | `Manifold.levelSet(sdf, bounds, edgeLen)` | (not available) | (mesh-only; not in BREP) |
| Mesh-level smoothing (rounded blob from cube) | `.smoothOut(angle).refine(n)` | (not available) | (mesh-only; not in BREP) |
| Arbitrary vertex warp (bend extrusion) | `.warp(fn)` | (not available) | (mesh-only; not in BREP) |

**Rule of thumb:** if you find yourself writing a `for` loop to manually compute curve points, stop and check whether `Curves` (manifold-js) or BOSL2 (SCAD) already has the verb. AI-generated point-sampling math is brittle; the helpers are deterministic.

**Cross-engine recipe:** Inside a manifold-js session, mix BREP for the feature that needs exactness and Manifold for everything else:

```js
const { Manifold, BREP } = api;
const bracket = BREP.toManifold(
  BREP.box([40, 20, 8]).fillet(2),    // exact fillet — BREP-true
  Manifold
);
const hole = Manifold.cylinder(20, 3, 3).translate([0, 0, -5]);
return bracket.subtract(hole);
```

No language switch needed. See `/ai/replicad.md` for the full BREP API and when to switch to a dedicated BREP session for STEP export.

## Topic index (subdocs)

The main reference splits into focused subdocs. **Fetch each by calling `readDoc({name: "<short-name>"})`** — that's a tool call, not a URL the model can navigate to. Pull a subdoc on demand instead of loading everything up front.

| `readDoc` name | When to read it |
|---|---|
| `curves` | Before writing manifold-js code with `Curves.loft/sweep/bezier/arc/naca4/polyline/fillet/...` (smooth curves, organic shapes, airfoils, lofted surfaces). |
| `sdf` | Before reaching for `api.sdf.*` — smooth blends (`smoothUnion`), domain warps (`twist`/`bend`), lattices (`gyroid`), constant-thickness shells. Anything the prompt frames as "smooth", "blended", "twisted", "lattice", or "gyroid" lives here. |
| `bosl2` | Before writing SCAD code that needs edge rounding (`cuboid(rounding=)`), threads (`screw`), gears (`spur_gear`), path-following (`path_sweep`), or attachables. |
| `replicad` | Before using `api.BREP.*` inside a manifold-js session, or before switching to the replicad/BREP language. Covers exact fillets/chamfers, STEP export, and the manifold-js ↔ BREP boundary. |
| `voxel` | Before writing voxel-language code or importing an image as voxels. Covers the `api.voxels()` grid API, colors, coordinate system, and image import. |
| `print-safety` | Before exporting STL/3MF for FDM printing — minimum wall thickness, taper traps, sub-extrusion-width layer detection. |
| `colors` | Before any paint operation — the picker decision tree, labelled construction, vision-driven painting, export behavior. |
| `reference-images` | When the user attaches a photo or asks you to model from one — `setImages` shape, label conventions, the five-step photo-to-model loop. |
| `file-io` | Before exporting or importing programmatically — `*Data()` byte-returning methods, Recent Exports inbox, session payload shape. |
| `annotations` | When the user has marked up the model with the Annotate tool (or you need to write annotations programmatically). |
| `relief` | When making an image-derived part (keychain / tile / silhouette / stepped relief) via `importImageAsRelief`, or reading the single-nozzle swap guide (`getReliefSwapGuide`) / optical preview (`setReliefPreviewMode`). |
| `iteration-workflow` | Before calling `runAndSave`, `forkVersion`, `modifyAndTest`, `createSessionWithVersions`, or managing session notes — the full versioning and iteration workflow. |
| `gotchas` | When something looks wrong — boolean overlap requirements, disconnected components, `paintRegion` on smooth surfaces, `probeRay` normals, `rotate` direction, painting locking the editor. |
| `visual-verification` | Before declaring a build done — all-faces check, edge overlay options, feature-specific checks, stat-based validation. |
| `spending` | To understand the user's compute budget and what each mode enforces or advises. |
| `manifold-api` | Quick reference for Manifold/CrossSection constructor and instance method signatures. |

## Common agent mistakes

- **Driving the UI with clicks/keystrokes** -- CodeMirror's auto-close-brackets will corrupt your code. Use `partwright.setCode()` and `partwright.run()` instead.
- **Forgetting `return`** -- code runs in `new Function()`, so a trailing expression is NOT automatically returned. You must write `return Manifold.cube(...)`.
- **Hand-rolling curve math instead of using helpers** -- if you need a smooth surface or curve, check the verb table above. `Curves.loft` / BOSL2 `skin()` are far more reliable than a hand-written polygon-sampling loop.
- **Not saving versions** -- a session is always open for you; save your work with `runAndSave` so the user can review it in the gallery.
- **Skipping visual verification** -- stats alone can't catch visual defects. After structural changes, call `renderViews()`; `renderViews({views: "box"})` is the only set that shows the back, left, and bottom faces.
- **Placing the front face on the wrong side** — "Front" in Partwright means the +Y face. The default Front view camera is at +Y looking toward −Y, so a door, a character's face, a screen, or any feature intended to face the viewer must have its outward normal pointing in the +Y direction. If `renderViews()` shows the back of your model in the "Front" tile, rotate the model 180° around Z (`model.rotate([0,0,180])`).
- **Flush boolean placement** -- shapes must overlap by at least 0.5 units to union correctly. Merely touching at a face produces disconnected components.
- **Tapering to a near-point on printed geometry** -- `scaleTop=[0.01, 0.01]` or chamfers that collapse the top to sub-millimeter area look fine in `geometry-data` but FDM slicers silently drop sub-extrusion-width layers, so the cap disappears on the print. See [/ai/print-safety.md](/ai/print-safety.md).
- **Not reading session context before modifying** -- when resuming work in an established session, call `getSessionContext()` first and read the notes/version history before making changes. See [Resuming a session](#resuming-a-session).
- **Branching off a prior version by hand** -- don't chain `loadVersion` -> `getCode` -> modify -> `runAndSave`. A silent failure (blocked return value, stale buffer) can drop parts of the parent. Use [`forkVersion({index} | {id}, transformFn, label, assertions?)`](#forking-a-prior-version) instead -- it loads the parent's code server-side, applies your transform, validates, and saves atomically.
- **Passing a bare index or id instead of `{index}` / `{id}`** -- `loadVersion` and `forkVersion` take an object with exactly one of `{index: number}` or `{id: string}`, e.g. `loadVersion({index: 2})` or `loadVersion({id: "Kx3Pq9mA2wEr"})`. Bare `loadVersion(2)` will return `{error: "...target must be { index: number } or { id: string }..."}`.
- **Passing the wrong object shape to `setImages`, `setReferenceGeometry`, `query`, `runAndAssert`, etc.** -- the API rejects unknown keys and wrong-type values. See [Argument validation](#argument-validation).
- **Doing `setCode` then `run` when you meant `runAndSave`.** `setCode` doesn't auto-run, `run` doesn't save and doesn't validate, and the gallery won't see the version. `runAndSave(code, label, assertions)` does all three atomically -- prefer it for committed iterations. See also [`runAndSave` is for committed iterations; `runIsolated` is for sanity checks](#runandsave-is-for-committed-iterations-runisolated-is-for-sanity-checks).
- **Passing a short stub to `runAndSave` intending to "save current state".** `runAndSave(code, ...)` is **authoritative**: it overwrites the editor with `code`, runs it, and saves the result. Passing anything other than the full intended code will replace the editor and save a broken version. To snapshot the editor as-is (e.g. after painting), call `saveVersion(label?)` instead — it captures the current code + geometry + colors without re-running.
- **Querying stale geometry after `setCode`.** `setCode` updates the editor but does NOT re-run. Calling `getGeometryData()` or `query()` after `setCode` (without a subsequent `runAndSave`/`run`) returns the geometry from the previous execution. The result now includes `stale: true` when the editor code hash doesn't match the last-run hash — treat this as a signal to run first.
- **No "fork from current editor" path.** `forkVersion({index}, ...)` forks a *saved* version. If your best code is unsaved in the editor, first call `await saveVersion("checkpoint")` to commit it as a version, then `forkVersion({index: <that index>}, ...)` from there. `listVersions()` shows the new index.

## Argument validation

Every `window.partwright` method validates its arguments at runtime. If you pass the wrong type or an object with unexpected keys, the call fails fast with a descriptive error rather than silently accepting bad input.

**Conventions:**

- **Methods that return a value** (e.g. `runAndSave`, `loadVersion`, `query`, `importSession`, `setReferenceGeometry`, notes/session CRUD) return `{ error: "..." }` on a validation failure. The error string names the exact parameter and expected type, e.g. `"setImages(images)[0].src must be a non-empty string, got "". See /ai.md#argument-validation"`.
- **Void setters** (`setCode`, `setClipZ`, `setImages`, `setView`, `setUnits`, `measureAt`, `measureBetween`, `probeRay`, `measurePoints`, `renameSession`) **throw** a `ValidationError`. Wrap calls in a try/catch if you want to handle failure rather than crash the console.
- **No coercion.** `setClipZ("5")` throws -- strings are not auto-converted to numbers. Pass the right type.
- **Unknown object keys are rejected.** `runAndAssert(code, { widthToDeep: [1,2] })` errors on the typo; it does not silently ignore it. Allowed keys are listed on each assertion/options interface.
- **Empty strings are rejected** by default for required string params (names, IDs, note text, code). Optional strings can be omitted but, if provided, must still be non-empty unless noted otherwise.

**Examples of what gets rejected:**

```js
partwright.navigateVersion('backward')            // ValidationError: direction must be one of: "prev" | "next"
partwright.setView('sketch')                      // ValidationError: tab must be one of: ...
partwright.measureAt([5])                         // ValidationError: measureAt(xy) must have exactly 2 elements
partwright.probeRay([0,0,0], [0, '1', 0])         // ValidationError: probeRay(direction)[1] must be a finite number
partwright.setImages([{ src: '' }])  // ValidationError: setImages(images)[0].src must be a non-empty string, got ""
partwright.setReferenceGeometry(code, { opacity: 2 })  // returns { success: false, error: "... .opacity must be <= 1 ..." }
await partwright.runAndAssert(code, { minVolume: '1000' })  // returns { passed: false, failures: ["... .minVolume must be a finite number ..."] }
await partwright.runAndSave(code, 'v1', { boundsRatio: { widthToDeep: [1,2] } })  // typo caught: not a recognized field
await partwright.query({ sliceAt: 5 })            // returns { error: "... .sliceAt must be an array ..." }
```

When you see a validation error, fix the call -- don't pattern-match around it.

## Geometry data

**Preferred:** Use `partwright.getGeometryData()` to read current geometry stats programmatically.

**Fallback** (if `window.partwright` is not yet initialized): read `document.getElementById("geometry-data").textContent` -- it contains the same JSON.

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "vertexCount": 8, "triangleCount": 12,
  "boundingBox": { "x":[-5,5], "y":[-5,5], "z":[-5,5], "dimensions":[10,10,10] },
  "centroid": [0,0,0],
  "volume": 1000, "surfaceArea": 600,
  "genus": 0, "isManifold": true, "componentCount": 1,
  "crossSections": {
    "z25": {"z":-2.5,"area":100,"contours":1},
    "z50": {"z":0,"area":100,"contours":1},
    "z75": {"z":2.5,"area":100,"contours":1}
  },
  "executionTimeMs": 12,
  "codeHash": "a1b2c3d4"
}
```

Extra fields that appear conditionally:
- **`containedComponents: N`** — present when N components are fully enclosed inside another solid (e.g. sealed interior voids in a voxel shell). These are excluded from `maxComponents` assertion checks and from the floater warning, since they can't detach in print. Use `runAndExplain(code)` to inspect them individually.
- **`stale: true`** — present when the editor code has changed since the last execution (e.g. `setCode` was called without a subsequent run). Stats reflect the *previous* run. Call `runAndSave`/`run` before relying on component counts or other metrics.
- **`warnings: string[]`** — present when the geometry has printability issues (non-manifold, free-floating components, etc.).

On error: `{"status":"error","error":"...","executionTimeMs":2,"codeHash":"..."}`

`partwright.run()` and `partwright.getGeometryData()` also include a `printability` field — see [Printability](#printability).

### Common errors
- `Code must return a Manifold object` -- forgot `return` statement
- `function _Cylinder called with N arguments` -- wrong arg count
- Geometry looks wrong -- check `isManifold` and `componentCount` (failed booleans = extra components)
- `componentCount > 1` with `containedComponents` present -- the extra components are sealed interior voids, not true floaters. No fix needed for printing; use `runAndExplain` if you need to inspect them.

## Writing model code (manifold-js)

Code runs in a sandbox via `new Function('api', code)`. All transforms return new immutable Manifold instances -- chaining works.

```js
const { Manifold, CrossSection, Curves, setCircularSegments } = api;
// MUST return a Manifold object
```

**Sandbox environment:** The `api` object provides:
- `Manifold` and `CrossSection` -- the raw manifold-3d bindings
- `Curves` -- helpers for smooth/organic shapes (loft, sweep, bezier, arc, naca4, polyline with fillet, arbitrary-axis revolve, fillet/chamfer, pattern arrays). See **[/ai/curves.md](/ai/curves.md)**.
- `params` -- declare tweakable **Customizer** knobs that surface as sliders/toggles in the viewport (see below).
- `sdf` -- signed-distance-field builder for smooth blends, twists, gyroids, and shells. Tree-of-expressions style, lowered to a Manifold via `.build()`. See **[/ai/sdf.md](/ai/sdf.md)**.
- `setCircularSegments`, `setMinCircularAngle`, `setMinCircularEdgeLength` -- global curve resolution defaults.

Standard JavaScript globals (`Math`, `Array`, `Object`, `JSON`, `Date`, `console`, etc.) are available. There is no DOM access, no `fetch`/network, no `require`/`import`, and no file I/O. Do not attempt to load external libraries or make HTTP requests in model code.

### Customizer parameters (`api.params`)

Declare the model's tweakable dimensions/options at the top via `api.params(schema)`. It returns an object of resolved values; a **Parameters panel** appears in the viewport so the user (or you) can adjust them with sliders/toggles/dropdowns and the model re-runs live — Tinkercad-style customization without leaving code. This is the preferred way to make a model reusable: expose the few dimensions someone would actually want to change.

`api.params` works the same in **manifold-js, voxel, and BREP (replicad) sessions** — all three are JS sandboxes that share one implementation. For `number`/`int` params the panel pairs a slider with an editable number field, so you can type an exact value (and exceed the slider's range when the spec declares no `max`).

**SCAD sessions** use OpenSCAD's own customizer convention instead of `api.params` (SCAD isn't a JS sandbox): annotate top-level variables and they surface in the *same* Parameters panel. Overrides are applied through OpenSCAD's native `-D` flag — no code rewriting. `getParams`/`setParams` and persistence work identically.

```scad
// Outer width            (a preceding line-comment becomes the tooltip)
width = 30;     // [10:100]        slider 10..100
rows  = 2;      // [1:1:6]         slider 1..6 step 1
style = "flat"; // [flat, round]   dropdown of strings
mode  = 1;      // [0:Off, 1:On]   dropdown (value:label)
label = "PART"; // 12              text, max length 12
solid = true;                      // checkbox
cube([width, width, rows * 10]);
```

Only top-level literal assignments become knobs; variables inside modules/functions are ignored, and a `/* [Hidden] */` group suppresses its members. Vectors and expression-valued variables aren't customizable.

```js
const { Manifold } = api;
const p = api.params({
  width:   { type: 'number',  default: 30, min: 10, max: 120, step: 1, unit: 'mm' },
  rows:    { type: 'int',     default: 2,  min: 1,  max: 6 },
  rounded: { type: 'boolean', default: true, label: 'Rounded corners' },
  style:   { type: 'select',  default: 'flat', options: ['flat', 'beveled', 'round'] },
  title:   { type: 'text',    default: 'PARTS', maxLength: 12 },
  accent:  { type: 'color',   default: '#3b82f6' },
});
// use p.width, p.rows, p.rounded, p.style, p.title, p.accent ...
return Manifold.cube([p.width, p.width, p.rows * 10], true);
```

**Types:** `number` / `int` (slider; `min`,`max`,`step`,`unit`), `boolean` (toggle), `select` (dropdown; `options` = array of strings or `{value,label}`), `text` (`maxLength`), `color` (hex). Optional `label` and `help` on any. A malformed *schema* throws a clear `api.params: …` error; bad *values* are clamped or fall back to the default, never throwing — so the model always renders. Reading an undeclared key (`p.widht`) throws too, so a typo can't silently become `NaN`.

**Driving it yourself:** `partwright.getParams()` returns `{ schema, values }` so you can see what knobs exist; `partwright.setParams({ width: 50, rows: 3 })` changes values and re-runs (the `getParams`/`setParams` tools do the same). Prefer `setParams` over rewriting code when you only need to change a declared dimension — it's cheaper and keeps the model intact. The chosen values persist with each saved version (so a version re-renders exactly as saved). A `color` param's value (a hex string) drives geometry color by passing it to `api.label(shape, name, { color: p.accent })` (see [Model-declared color](#model-declared-color-self-coloring-models) below) — so a color knob recolors the model live. `text` params are captured but have no geometry sink yet.

### Model-declared color (self-coloring models)

Give a label a color right in the code and it renders **and exports** colored — no separate paint step, and the editor stays editable:

```js
const { Manifold } = api;
const body = api.label(Manifold.cube([20, 20, 20], true), 'body', { color: '#3b82f6' });
const knob = api.label(Manifold.cylinder(6, 4, 4, 32).translate([0, 0, 13]), 'knob', { color: [1, 0, 0] });
return body.add(knob);   // renders blue body + red knob; GLB/3MF carry the colors
```

The `color` is a hex string (`'#rrggbb'` / `'#rgb'`, the same form a `color` param produces) or an `[r,g,b]` array in 0..1. `api.labeledUnion([{ name, shape, color }, …])` takes the same per-entry `color`. Because the color travels with the labelled name, it **re-resolves every run** — so it survives Customizer parameter changes, and a `color` param wired in as `{ color: p.accent }` recolors the model live. For per-instance color (e.g. a parametric count), give each instance a distinct name: `api.label(petal, 'petal' + i, { color: … })`.

Model-declared colors are a derived **underlay**: manual paint (the paint tools / `paintByLabel`) composites on top as an optional override, and only manual paint locks the editor. They are **not** written into the saved paint sidecar — they come from the code, so re-running re-derives them. Inspect the active set with `partwright.getModelColors()` → `{ count, colors: [{ name, color, triangleCount }] }`; an empty `triangleCount` for a name means that label's triangles were consumed by a later boolean (check `listLabels().lostLabels`). See **[/ai/colors.md](/ai/colors.md)**.

### Primitive origins and orientations

```
cube([x,y,z])         -> spans [0,0,0] to [x,y,z]. center=true -> centered at origin
sphere(r, n?)         -> centered at origin
cylinder(h,rLo,rHi?,n?) -> Z-axis, base z=0, top z=h. rHi=0 for cone
tetrahedron()          -> vertices at [1,1,1],[1,-1,-1],[-1,1,-1],[-1,-1,1]. Scale to size.
extrude(cs, h, nDiv?, twist?, scaleTop?, center?)
  -> along Z, z=0 to z=h. twist=degrees, scaleTop=number or [x,y] (0 for cone point)
revolve(cs, n?, degrees?)
  -> around Y axis, then remaps so result is Z-up.
    Profile X=radial distance, Y=height -> after revolve, Y becomes Z automatically.
    Only positive-X side used. degrees defaults to 360.
Segments: OMIT the segment argument so curves inherit the user's quality
  preset (recommended). Pass an explicit 6-8 only for an intentional
  low-poly look; only override upward when one specific feature needs more
  resolution than the preset. Never hard-code a low count (e.g. 32) just to
  "make it smooth" — that shadows the preset and looks chunky to the user.
```

**Default segment count:** Partwright seeds `setCircularSegments()` (and `$fn` for OpenSCAD) from the user's Modeling Quality preset (gear icon in the toolbar) before each run. Presets are Low (16) / Medium (32) / High (64) / Very High (128, the default) / Ultra (1024), plus a **Custom** option for an exact count (3–4096). So curves render smooth out of the box without any explicit configuration — and a user who wants ultra-smooth output picks **Ultra** (or a Custom value) once and it persists. **An explicit segments argument always overrides this preset for that primitive**, so leave it off unless you specifically want a different resolution than the user chose. The current preset is reported in the per-turn "Session toggle state" suffix; honor it. You can still call `setCircularSegments(n)` or pass an explicit count to override on a per-script or per-call basis when a design genuinely needs it.

### Constructors and instance methods

`readDoc({name: "manifold-api"})` for the full constructor list (Manifold, CrossSection, Curves, sdf, meshOps) and Manifold/CrossSection instance method signatures.

### Mesh-operations helpers (`api.meshOps`, also flat as `api.*`)

These are agent-leverage helpers: tasks you'd otherwise solve with mental trig (placement), boolean-fails-silently bugs (expectUnion), or "is this point inside?" introspection guesses.

**Predicates — return plain values, never mutate inputs.** Use them to validate your own work before declaring a build done.

```
api.intersects(a, b)             // true if a∩b has any volume (bbox fast-reject)
api.contains(outer, inner)       // true if inner ⊂ outer
api.pointInside(m, [x,y,z])      // true if point is inside the solid
api.bbox(m)                      // { min, max, size, center } — the missing accessor
api.componentBounds(m)           // [{ index, volume, triangleCount, bbox }], largest first
api.volumeDelta(a, b)            // b.volume() - a.volume()
```

**Alignment + patterns — return a Manifold, lazy/chainable.** These eat the mental-trig category of bug ("I rotated 60° times 6 but accidentally went CW"; "the lid should sit on the box top but I added the box height to the wrong axis").

```
api.alignTo(shape, target, {x?, y?, z?})
   // axes are 'min'|'max'|'center' (also left/right/top/bottom/front/back).
   // target: a Manifold | 'origin' | { min:[x,y,z], max:[x,y,z] } literal.

api.placeOn(shape, target, {at?, gap?})
   // shape's minZ → target's maxZ.
   // at: 'center' (default — match target's XY center)
   //     'preserve' — keep shape's own XY (skip re-centering)
   //     [x, y]    — match a specific point
   // gap: 0 leaves a touching seam (boolean treats as 2 pieces);
   //      negative (e.g. -0.5) overlaps volumetrically — what you usually want.

api.mirrorAcross(shape, plane)            // plane: 'x'|'y'|'z' or a normal vector
api.mirrorCopy(shape, plane)              // shape unioned with its mirror — symmetric parts
api.linearPattern(shape, count, step)     // step: number (X) or [x,y,z] vector

api.circularPattern(shape, count, {axis?, angle?, center?, radius?})
   // axis: 'z' default; angle: 360 default = full ring.
   // ENDPOINT CONVENTION:
   //   angle === ±360 → N copies at 360/N (no duplicate at seam).
   //   any other angle → endpoints INCLUSIVE: first copy at 0°, last at angle°
   //                     (step = angle/(count-1)).
   // radius: shortcut — pushes shape outward by `radius` BEFORE rotating
   //   (so you write `circularPattern(stud, 8, {radius: 25})` instead of
   //   pre-translating the stud yourself).

api.spiralPattern(shape, count, {anglePerCopy, risePerCopy, axis?, center?})
   // The "staircase / screw / spring" case — each copy gets both a rotation
   // AND an axial translation. Steps + helical fins + threaded rod profile
   // all fall under this one.
```

**Robust booleans + heal — catch silent failures.** `expectUnion` is the one to reach for when an agent has hit "I expected one piece, got three" — it tells you *immediately* instead of after the next render, and the error message includes a bbox/volume dump of each component so you can see which piece floated free.

```
api.expectUnion(parts, {expectComponents: 1})   // union + component-count check
api.expectDifference(a, b, {expectNonEmpty: true})
api.expectComponents(m, n)                      // standalone "is m exactly n pieces?" predicate
api.heal(m, {tolerance?})                       // .simplify() + status check, for STL imports / suspect booleans
```

Examples:

```js
const { Manifold } = api;
// Lid sitting on a box, centered, with 0.5mm gap so they don't fuse:
const box = Manifold.cube([40, 20, 10], true);
const lid = Manifold.cube([40, 20, 2], true);
return api.expectUnion([box, api.placeOn(lid, box, { gap: 0.5 })], { expectComponents: 2 });

// 6 legs around a table column, with a runtime check that they actually merged:
const column = Manifold.cylinder(20, 2, 2);
const leg = Manifold.cube([2, 6, 18], true).translate([0, 5, 9]); // pre-positioned
return api.expectUnion([column, api.circularPattern(leg, 6)], { expectComponents: 1 });

// Did the boolean carve too much? Did it carve anything?
const after = body.subtract(carveout);
if (api.volumeDelta(body, after) === 0) throw new Error("subtract did nothing");
```

## Writing OpenSCAD code

When the engine is set to `scad`, code is compiled by OpenSCAD (WASM) instead of running as JavaScript.

**Key differences from manifold-js:**
- **No `return` statement** -- SCAD uses implicit top-level geometry. Just write `cube(10);`, not `return Manifold.cube(...)`.
- **SCAD syntax** -- standard OpenSCAD: `module`, `function`, `for`, `let`, `if/else`, `use`, `include`.
- **Built-in primitives** -- `cube`, `sphere`, `cylinder`, `polyhedron`, `polygon`, `circle`, `square`, `text` (text not available -- fonts not loaded).
- **Transforms** -- `translate`, `rotate`, `scale`, `mirror`, `multmatrix`, `color`, `resize`.
- **Booleans** -- `union()`, `difference()`, `intersection()`, `hull()`, `minkowski()`.
- **Extrusion** -- `linear_extrude(height, twist, slices, scale)`, `rotate_extrude(angle)`.
- **2D rounding** -- `offset(r=...)` for rounded outlines; `minkowski() { shape; circle(r); }` for rounded interiors.
- **Curve resolution** -- `$fn=N` for explicit segments, or `$fa`/`$fs` for angle/length-based segmentation.
- **The `--enable=manifold` flag is set automatically** -- OpenSCAD uses the same manifold-3d boolean backend, so CSG results match the JS engine.

**BOSL2 library is bundled** -- start your file with `include <BOSL2/std.scad>` to unlock rounded cuboids, skin/loft, sweep, threaded rods, gears, attachables, and pattern distributors. See **[/ai/bosl2.md](/ai/bosl2.md)**. First BOSL2 run on a fresh page fetches ~4 MB of library source (one-time, then cached).

**Known limitations:**
- `text()` is not available (font data not loaded to save ~8MB).
- External `.scad` libraries (other than the bundled BOSL2) can't be `include`d -- there's no filesystem to read from.
- Each SCAD run creates a fresh WASM instance (~100-300ms overhead). For fast iteration, manifold-js is snappier.

**Example SCAD code (stock):**
```scad
// Cube with cylindrical hole
difference() {
  cube([10, 10, 10], center=true);
  cylinder(h=12, r=4, center=true, $fn=32);
}
```

**Example SCAD code (BOSL2):**
```scad
include <BOSL2/std.scad>
cuboid([40, 30, 20], rounding=3);     // all edges filleted
```

### Mesh-operations equivalents in SCAD

The `api.*` mesh-ops helpers (intersects, placeOn, circularPattern, expectUnion…) are sandbox helpers exclusive to manifold-js. SCAD has native equivalents — most of them in BOSL2:

| `api.*` helper (manifold-js) | SCAD / BOSL2 equivalent |
|---|---|
| `api.placeOn(a, b)` (place A on top of B) | BOSL2 `attach(TOP, BOTTOM)` on attachable parents (`cuboid(... ){ attach(...) cuboid(...); }`) |
| `api.alignTo(a, b, {...})` | BOSL2 `position(<anchor>)` + `anchor=<anchor>` on attachable shapes |
| `api.linearPattern(s, n, step)` | BOSL2 `xcopies(spacing, n=)`, `ycopies(...)`, `zcopies(...)` |
| `api.circularPattern(s, n)` | BOSL2 `ring_copies(n=N, r=R)` (or `rot_copies(rots=[...])`) |
| `api.mirrorCopy(s, plane)` | BOSL2 `mirror_copy([nx,ny,nz])` |
| `api.expectUnion(parts, {expectComponents})` | No language-level equivalent — read `componentCount` off `getGeometryData()` after running and assert in JS test harness |

The **introspection helpers** (cross-section image, per-piece bbox, point-in-solid, healing) work the same regardless of engine — they're on `window.partwright`:

```js
partwright.renderSection({ axis: 'z', offset: 5 })   // SVG data URL of the slice
partwright.componentBounds()                          // per-piece bbox/volume for the current model
partwright.pointInside([0, 0, 5])                     // true / false
partwright.healCurrent()                              // simplify + rebuild current geometry
```

These are engine-agnostic — call them after a SCAD render to debug cavities, find leaked components, or clean up a problematic boolean result.

## Common pitfalls & gotchas

`readDoc({name: "gotchas"})` — boolean overlap requirements, disconnected components, `paintRegion` bimodal on smooth surfaces, trusting `probeRay` normals, `rotate` direction convention, painting locking the editor, and `runAndSave` vs `runIsolated`.

## Printability

Every `runAndSave`, `run`, and `getGeometryData` response now includes:

```json
"printability": { "printable": true, "issues": [] }
```

`printable` is `false` when either condition holds:
- `isManifold: false` — mesh has gaps or non-manifold edges (not watertight, slicer will reject or produce holes)
- `componentCount > 1` — model has disconnected solids; floaters print as separate pieces or fail support generation

**Always check `printability.printable` after `runAndSave`.** If it is `false`:
1. Read `printability.issues` for the specific problems.
2. For disconnected components, call `runAndExplain(code)` to see which pieces are floating and get overlap suggestions.
3. Fix the geometry and re-save. Do not leave a saved version with `printable: false` as the final result of a build task — the user intends to print it.

Voxel models are especially prone to `componentCount > 1` because every isolated island of voxels becomes its own component. After building a voxel scene, always verify `printability.printable`. If components > 1, either bridge the floating islands with connecting voxels, or confirm with the user that the separate pieces are intentional.

```js
const r = await partwright.runAndSave(code, 'v1');
if (!r.printability.printable) {
  // r.printability.issues: e.g. ["3 disconnected components"]
  // fix the code, then re-save
}
```

## Print-safe geometry

For 3D-printable output (FDM/FFF), features thinner than the nozzle's extrusion width are silently dropped by the slicer even though `geometry-data` (volume, `componentCount`, `genus`, `isManifold`) looks correct. The classic trap is `scaleTop` near zero tapering to sub-extrusion-width layers near `zMax`.

Before exporting anything intended for printing, **call `readDoc({name: "print-safety"})`** for the rules of thumb, the dense-sample slice check, and the worked failure mode.

## Color regions

Color regions tag a coplanar set of triangles with an RGB color. Regions are persisted on the saved version, ride through GLB and 3MF exports (vertex colors / `<basematerials>` `pid` attributes), and show as swatch badges in the gallery. They do **not** modify the geometry. STL and OBJ exports drop them — formats don't carry color.

The paint helpers are exposed both as tool calls (`paintRegion`, `paintFaces`, `paintNear`, `paintStroke`, `paintInBox`, `paintSlab`, `paintNearestRegion`, `paintComponent`, `paintByLabel`, `paintByLabels`, `paintConnected`, `paintPreview`, `paintExplain`, `findFaces`, `probePixel`, `probeRay`, `getMeshSummary`, `listComponents`, `listLabels`, `undoLastPaint`, `redoLastPaint`, `removeRegion`, `clearColors`) and on `window.partwright`.

Before painting anything substantial, **call `readDoc({name: "colors"})`** for the picker decision tree (which `paint*` for which intent), the labelled-construction workflow, vision-driven painting with `probePixel`/`paintConnected`, undo/redo, and export behavior.

## AI-friendly file I/O

The standard `exportGLB()` / `exportSTL()` / `exportOBJ()` / `export3MF()` methods trigger a browser download — an AI agent can't observe what landed in the user's Downloads folder. Use the `*Data()` siblings (`exportGLBData()`, `exportSTLData()`, …) to get the bytes back as base64 over the API instead, and `importSessionData()` to import a session payload without touching the OS file picker.

**Call `readDoc({name: "file-io"})`** before exporting or importing programmatically — covers the Recent Exports inbox, the full method list, and the import payload shape.

## Reference images & photo-to-model

The user can attach reference photos via `partwright.setImages([...])`; they appear in the Images tab and Gallery. There's also an analyze-and-build workflow that takes a single photo and bootstraps a model from it.

**Call `readDoc({name: "reference-images"})`** when the user attaches a photo or asks you to model something from an image — covers `setImages` arguments, label conventions for elevation matching, and the five-step photo-to-model loop (major masses first, verify each elevation, iterate details).

## Iteration workflow

`readDoc({name: "iteration-workflow"})` — `runAndSave`, `runIsolated`, `runAndAssert`, `modifyAndTest`, `forkVersion`, `createSessionWithVersions`, `copyColorsFromVersion`, session notes (with prefix conventions), resuming a session with `getSessionContext()`, and the recommended step-by-step pattern.

### Assert + save in one call

`runAndSave` accepts optional assertions. If provided, validates in isolation first -- fails fast
without saving if assertions don't pass. On success, saves the version and returns stat diff:
```js
const r = await partwright.runAndSave(code, "v2 - added towers", {
  isManifold: true, maxComponents: 1
});
// If assertions fail: r.passed = false, r.failures = [...], version NOT saved
// If assertions pass (or no assertions given):
// r.passed         = true (only present when assertions provided)
// r.geometry       = full geometry stats
// r.printability   = { printable: true/false, issues: [] }   ← check this always
// r.version        = { id, index, label }
// r.diff           = { volume: { from, to, delta }, componentCount: ..., ... }
// r.galleryUrl     = gallery URL for human review
```

### Forking a prior version

When iterating on a design, the common flow is *load a previous version, tweak it, save as a new version*.
Doing that across separate `loadVersion` -> `getCode` -> modify -> `runAndSave` calls is fragile: if any
step fails silently (wrong arg type, a client-side content filter on `getCode`, etc.) you can end up saving
a regression without noticing. `forkVersion` collapses the whole chain into one server-side call:

```js
const r = await partwright.forkVersion(
  { index: 11 },                       // or { id: "Kx3Pq9mA2wEr" } from listVersions()
  code => code.replace('towerH = 28', 'towerH = 35'),
  "v11a - taller towers",              // label for the new version
  { isManifold: true, maxComponents: 1 }, // optional assertions (validated before saving)
  true                                  // carryColors (default true) — re-apply parent colors
);
// On success:
//   r.passed       = true (only when assertions provided)
//   r.parent       = { id, index, label } of the version you forked from
//   r.geometry     = full geometry stats
//   r.version      = { id, index, label } of the newly saved version
//   r.diff         = stat diff vs. the previous current version
//   r.codeDiff     = { changed, added, removed, diff } — what actually changed in the SOURCE.
//                    Verify your transform landed here: changed:false means the code is
//                    byte-identical to the parent (your edit was a no-op).
//   r.colors       = { carried: [names], dropped: [names] } when the parent had colors
//   r.galleryUrl   = gallery URL for human review
// On failure:
//   r.error        = "No version found with index ..." / "transformFn threw: ..." / etc.
//   r.passed=false + r.failures=[...] if assertions didn't pass (nothing saved)
```

`target` is an object with exactly one of `{ index }` (numeric, 1-based) or `{ id }` (string from
`listVersions()[].id`). The two are never mixed, so there's no ambiguity about which field is being
looked up. This is the recommended way to build parallel branches (v11a, v11b, ...) off a shared
parent without a load/read/modify/save round-trip chain.

**Color carry-over.** If the parent version has color regions, `forkVersion` re-applies them to the
forked geometry automatically — each region's geometry-relative descriptor (box / slab / `byLabel` /
coplanar / connected-from-seed) is re-resolved against the new mesh, so a dimension tweak does **not**
force you to repaint. Regions whose descriptor no longer matches (a label the new code dropped, raw
triangle ids on changed topology) are skipped and reported in `r.colors.dropped`. Pass `carryColors:
false` for an intentionally uncolored fork.

> When the AI tool form is used, pass `patches: [{find, replace}, ...]` instead of a `transformFn`.
> Each `find` must occur **exactly once** in the parent code — a find that matches zero or multiple
> times is rejected with an error rather than silently saving the parent unchanged, so copy the exact
> text (whitespace included) from `getCode()`/`loadVersion()`.

### Copying colors onto a rebuilt version

When you rebuild geometry from scratch with `runAndSave` (rather than forking) but it matches an
earlier *painted* version, transfer the colors in one call instead of repainting region by region:

```js
const r = await partwright.copyColorsFromVersion({ index: 7 }); // the painted version
// r.source  = { index, label }
// r.carried = [names] re-resolved onto the current mesh
// r.dropped = [names] whose descriptor no longer matches — repaint those
```

This is in-memory like any paint op — your next `runAndSave` serializes the current regions, so they
persist with it. (You don't need this after `forkVersion`, which already carries colors.)

### Modify and test

Modify current editor code with a transform function and test the result without committing:
```js
const r = await partwright.modifyAndTest(
  code => code.replace('towerH = 28', 'towerH = 35'),
  { isManifold: true, maxComponents: 1 }
);
// r.modifiedCode = the transformed code string
// r.codeDiff     = { changed, added, removed, diff } — confirm the tweak landed.
//                  changed:false means your transform matched nothing (a no-op);
//                  the stats below would then describe the UNCHANGED code.
// r.stats        = geometry stats of the modified code
// r.passed       = true/false (only if assertions given)
// r.failures     = [...] (only if failed)
```

> Prefer the AI tool's `find`/`replace` (or `patches`) form over a bare `code => code.replace(...)`
> transform: a string `replace` whose needle is absent returns the code **unchanged with no error**,
> so the tweak silently no-ops. The `find`/`replace` form is rejected when the needle doesn't match
> exactly once. Either way, check `codeDiff.changed` before trusting the result.

### Multi-query current geometry

Query multiple properties of the already-computed geometry in a single call:
```js
const r = partwright.query({
  sliceAt: [5, 10, 15, 20],  // cross-sections at these Z heights
  decompose: true,             // component breakdown
  boundingBox: true,           // bounding box
});
// r.slices     = { z5: {area, contours, ...}, z10: {...}, ... }
// r.components = [{ index, volume, centroid, boundingBox }, ...]
// r.boundingBox = { min: [...], max: [...] }
// r.stats      = current geometry-data stats
```

### Batch session creation

Create a complete session with multiple versions in one call:
```js
const r = await partwright.createSessionWithVersions("Castle", [
  { code: v1Code, label: "v1 - walls" },
  { code: v2Code, label: "v2 - towers" },
  { code: v3Code, label: "v3 - gate" },
]);
// r.session = {id, name}
// r.versions = [{version, geometry}, ...]
// r.galleryUrl = "/editor?session=abc&gallery"
```

### Session notes -- tracking design context

Use session notes to build a persistent record of the design story. This enables any agent (or human) resuming the session later to understand what happened and why.

**When to log notes:**
- Before first version: log the user's requirements and constraints
- On each version: include rationale in the label and optional `notes` field
- When the user gives feedback: log it as a note, then save the next version
- On key decisions: log dimensions, materials, constraints, tradeoffs
- On failed attempts: log what didn't work and why

**Prefix conventions** (so notes are scannable):
```js
await partwright.addSessionNote("[REQUIREMENT] 5.5x5.5x36in boards, snap-on C-channel, screw holes");
await partwright.addSessionNote("[FEEDBACK] User: groove looks too shallow, wants full tongue insertion");
await partwright.addSessionNote("[DECISION] Omitted right wall on end pieces for clearance");
await partwright.addSessionNote("[MEASUREMENT] Tongue width = outerW - 2*wallT = 133.7mm");
await partwright.addSessionNote("[ATTEMPT] v2 tried 3mm walls but too flimsy. Increased to 5mm in v3");
await partwright.addSessionNote("[TODO] Add chamfer to bottom edge for easier print removal");
```

Version-level notes go in the `runAndSave` assertions object:
```js
await partwright.runAndSave(code, "v2 - widened tongue per feedback", {
  isManifold: true,
  notes: "Changed tabW from 20mm to outerW - 2*wallT per user request"
});
```

### Resuming a session

When opening a session you haven't worked on (or returning after time away), **always call `getSessionContext()` first**:
```js
await partwright.openSession(sessionId);
const ctx = await partwright.getSessionContext();
// ctx.session    -- {id, name, created, updated}
// ctx.versions   -- [{index, label, timestamp, notes?, geometrySummary: {volume, boundingBox, ...}}]
// ctx.notes      -- [{id, text, timestamp}]  (all session notes)
// ctx.currentVersion -- {index, label}
// ctx.versionCount
// ctx.agentHints -- {apiDocsUrl, recommendedEntrypoint, codeMustReturnManifold, recentErrors, spending}
//   recentErrors: last 5 validation errors from this page session (helps avoid repeating mistakes)
```

Read the notes and version history before making changes. The notes tell you:
- What the user originally asked for (`[REQUIREMENT]` notes)
- What was tried and why (`[DECISION]` and `[ATTEMPT]` notes)
- What feedback the user gave (`[FEEDBACK]` notes)
- What measurements or constraints matter (`[MEASUREMENT]` notes)
- What still needs to be done (`[TODO]` notes)

### Recommended iteration pattern

1. Write initial code, assert+save in one call: `runAndSave(code, "v1 - base", {isManifold: true, maxComponents: 1})`

## Visual verification

**Stats alone cannot catch visual defects.** Always call `renderViews({views: "box"})` before declaring done — it shows all six orthographic faces including back, left, and bottom where mistakes hide.

`readDoc({name: "visual-verification"})` — render tiers, edge overlay (`edges: 'crease'|'none'|'wireframe'`), feature-specific checks, and stat-based validation.

## Spending mode

Read `partwright.getSpendingMode()` at session start and honor the user's budget (`cheap`/`balanced`/`expensive`/`custom`). Also in `getSessionContext().agentHints.spending`.

`readDoc({name: "spending"})` for what each mode enforces (painting toggle, render resolution, session notes) and what you should adjust (thinking level, image verification frequency, pacing).

## Annotations

Users can mark up the model surface with the **Annotate** tool (✏️ in the viewport overlay): freehand strokes raycast onto the mesh, and text labels pinned to a 3D anchor. Annotations are per-version, persist in session exports, and are distinct from color regions — they do not modify geometry or lock the editor.

**Call `readDoc({name: "annotations"})`** when the user has placed annotations and you want to read them, or when you need to write annotations programmatically — covers the `getAnnotations` / `setAnnotations` shape and the persistence model.
